  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Go345 ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use the Go345 mobile application and related services (collectively, the "App").</p>

  </ul>

  <h3>Information from third parties</h3>

  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>

  </ul>

  <h3>Third‑Party SDKs and Services</h3>

  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>

    <li>When you delete your account or request deletion, we delete or anonymize personal information, unless retention is required by law, to resolve disputes, or enforce agreements.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, to protect transfers.</p>
